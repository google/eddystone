# Eddystone Implementations
There are two goals of this list:

* Collect a list of Eddystone beacon open source implementations that fully support the [Eddystone protocol](https://github.com/google/eddystone/blob/master/protocol-specification.md) and the [GATT configuration service](https://github.com/google/eddystone/blob/master/configuration-service)
* Encourage embedding Eddystone functionality into other products (usually by adding additional GATT services to the beacon)

Any forks of these projects that add functionality should also be listed here as long as they too are forkable


* [ARM mbed](mbed)
* [Nordic](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrf5-sdk-for-eddystone)
