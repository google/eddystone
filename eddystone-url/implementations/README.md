# Eddystone-URL Beacon Implementations

## About this Directory

There are several companies that have developed their own proprietary Eddystone URL beacon from the open 
specification available on this website. In this directory we are publishing source for the
Eddystone-URL beacon than can be compiled with publicly available SDKs and development boards
under the licenses described in each subdirectory. These projects serve as a guide for you to
write you own Eddystone-URL beacon code. We encourage you to add additional examples.
To date, in this directory you will find the following implementations:

* [Arduino (BLEPeripheral)](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-BLEPeripheral/blob/master/examples/Eddystone/EddystoneURL/EddystoneURL.ino), a list of compatible hardware can be found [here](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-BLEPeripheral#compatible-hardware).
